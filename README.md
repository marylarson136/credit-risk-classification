Credit Risk Analysis
This analysis is intended to determine the accuracy of the machine learning model in predicting safe versus high-risk loans. The data provided included the amount of the loan, the interest rate, the income of the borrower, and the ratio of the debt to the person’s income. To do the analysis, we split the data into training and testing sets, then used a logistic regression model. Finally, we generated a confusion matrix and classification report to evaluate the model’s performance.
Based on the results, I would say this model is very accurate, as the accuracy score came out at 99%. The confusion matrix also shows that there are proportionately few false positives or false negatives in relation to the number of true positives and true negatives. The majority of the results aligned with what the model predicted. I would use this model to make loan recommendations.
